# Critical Issues Found During Live Testing

## âœ… **WORKING CORRECTLY:**
- Facebook login and authentication âœ…
- Live Instagram data loading (50 posts from Generation Vegan) âœ…
- Comment loading with contextual sample comments âœ…
- Individual comment sentiment analysis âœ…
- Database saving (comments saved successfully) âœ…
- Professional UI with OpenPaws.ai branding âœ…

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:**

### 1. **Total Comments Metric Not Updating**
- **Problem**: Shows "0 TOTAL COMMENTS" despite loading 4 comments
- **Expected**: Should show "4 TOTAL COMMENTS" after loading comments
- **Impact**: Dashboard metrics are inaccurate

### 2. **Post Images Not Loading**
- **Problem**: All posts show empty image areas
- **Expected**: Should display Instagram post images
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, missing visual content

### 3. **Sentiment Analysis Too Generic**
- **Problem**: All posts show "neutral (50% confidence)" 
- **Expected**: Posts about factory farming should show negative sentiment
- **Example**: "kills male chicks" should be negative, not neutral
- **Impact**: Inaccurate sentiment analysis

### 4. **Post Sentiment Analysis Algorithm**
- **Problem**: Current algorithm doesn't recognize negative words like "kill", "suffer", "die"
- **Expected**: Should detect negative sentiment in animal rights content
- **Impact**: Misleading business intelligence

## ðŸ”§ **FIXES NEEDED:**
1. Update metrics calculation to include loaded comments
2. Fix image loading from Instagram media URLs
3. Enhance sentiment analysis for animal rights/factory farming content
4. Add negative keywords specific to this industry
5. Improve confidence scoring for sentiment analysis

## ðŸ“Š **CURRENT STATUS:**
- **Posts Loaded**: 50 âœ…
- **Comments Loaded**: 4 âœ… (but not reflected in metrics)
- **Database Integration**: Working âœ…
- **UI/UX**: Professional âœ…
- **Sentiment Accuracy**: Needs improvement ðŸš¨
