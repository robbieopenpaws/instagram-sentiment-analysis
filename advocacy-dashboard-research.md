# Advocacy Dashboard Design Research - Key Findings

## Best Practices for Advocacy Effectiveness Visualization

### Core Components (from NewMode Advocacy Dashboard):

1. **Impact Score** - Single overarching score (e.g., 6.5/10) with visual progress bar
   - Analyzes multiple data points for effectiveness
   - Color-coded evaluation (green = excellent, yellow = good, red = needs improvement)
   - Clear numerical rating with context

2. **Impact Insights** - Key metrics with color-coded evaluation bars
   - Visual indicators for performance levels
   - Specific policy impact metrics
   - Easy-to-scan color coding system

3. **Engagement Recommendations** - Actionable suggestions panel
   - Recommendations to increase conversion rates
   - Campaign sharing optimization tips
   - Policy impact enhancement suggestions

### Visual Design Principles:

- **Progress bars** for scores and effectiveness ratings
- **Color-coded systems** (green/yellow/red) for quick assessment
- **Numerical scores** with context (e.g., 6.5/10, "Excellent")
- **Clean, scannable layout** with clear sections
- **Actionable recommendations** prominently displayed

### Key Metrics to Display:

- **Conversion Rate** - How many people changed behavior
- **Engagement Level** - Depth of audience interaction  
- **Policy Impact** - Real-world effectiveness measurement
- **Audience Reach** - Scope of influence
- **Behavioral Change Indicators** - Specific actions taken

### For Vegan Advocacy Specifically:

- **Conversion Potential** - % likely to reduce/eliminate animal products
- **Resistance Level** - % showing defensive responses
- **Advocacy Amplification** - % sharing/spreading message
- **Behavioral Commitment** - % making specific commitments (going vegan, etc.)
- **Mind Change Indicators** - "eye opening", "never knew", "changed my perspective"

### UI/UX Recommendations:

1. **Impact Score Card** - Large, prominent score with progress bar
2. **Conversion Funnel** - Visual representation of advocacy effectiveness
3. **Behavioral Change Tracker** - Specific actions and commitments
4. **Resistance Analysis** - Understanding pushback and cognitive dissonance
5. **Recommendation Engine** - Suggestions for improving effectiveness

### Color Coding System:
- **Green**: High conversion/effectiveness (Anti-Animal Agriculture responses)
- **Blue**: Moderate effectiveness (Questioning/Conflicted responses)  
- **Yellow**: Neutral/Supportive (Already Vegan responses)
- **Orange**: Resistance (Defensive responses)
- **Red**: Low effectiveness (Pro-Animal Agriculture responses)
